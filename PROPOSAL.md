# IDEAS:
Note: For all games, WASD and IJKL will be used for player movement. Two other keys will be utilized for actions such as pick up/drop/throw. Other players will be bots. There is also a one-player option.

Boomerang: A multi-player game that involves players throwing boomerangs at each other in an obstacle-filled setting. Players die once they are hit by the boomerang. Players can also pick up orbs to gain special abilities. There are a total of 15 rounds, each round ends with the last man standing. 

Overcooked: A replica of the actual Overcooked game on Nintendo. Most features such as moving kitchen floors, tasks, and level intesity will be implemented as in the actual game. There will be two teams: The players can choose to join the same team and compete against bots or join different teams (against each other) accompanied by bots.

Boomerang X Overcooked: Overcooked but with knife throwing when a designated number of tasks are complete. Players will have a chance to stun members of the opposing team.
